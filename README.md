5. [Course 5: Applied Social Network Analysis in Python](#Course-5:-Applied-Social-Network-Analysis-in-Python)



## Course 1: Introduction to Data Science in Python

Introduces the basics of python programming libraries for data science. Use of pandas library to read, clean, sort and manipulate data and SciPy.stats for statistical analysis.


* Week 2 assignment: Pandas Introduction Part 1: Data analysis on olympic medal data extracted from Wikipedia with the use of Pandas. Part 2:  Data analysis of US census state and county data.

* Week 3 assignment: More Pandas: Intricate Data cleaning and manipulation. Imported three datasets which were cleaned, joined and reduced. Explored the data and investigated the summary statistics and correlations.

* Week 4 assignment: Hypothesis Testing: This assignment tests the hypothesis of the 2008 recesion in the US having an effect on the house prices in university towns as much as it had on other towns. Initially three datasets (housing data, university towns, timeseries of GPD) were cleaned and merged. Then the start the end and the lowest recession quarters were calculated. Lastly a t-test was performed comparing the university town values to the non-university towns values to find whether the hypothetsis of university towns being less affected by the recession is true or not.






























*Originally the assignments were done with the use of the Anaconda Jupyter notebook and the latest versions of the libraries used. Some of the assignments have been edited to comply with the Coursera online Jupyter Notebook which at the time of submission was out of date.
