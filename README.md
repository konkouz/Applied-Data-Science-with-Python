## Course 1: Introduction to Data Science in Python

Introduces the basics of python programming libraries for data science. Use of pandas library to read, clean, sort and manipulate data and SciPy.stats for statistical analysis.


* Week 2 assignment: Pandas Introduction Part 1: Data analysis on olympic medal data extracted from Wikipedia with the use of Pandas. Part 2:  Data analysis of US census state and county data.

* Week 3 assignment: More Pandas: Intricate Data cleaning and manipulation. Imported three datasets which were cleaned, joined and reduced. Explored the data and investigated the summary statistics and correlations.

* Week 4 assignment: Hypothesis Testing Hypothesis testing looking at the effect of the 2008 recession on house prices in university towns. three datasets were cleaned and merged. The recession start, length and bottom were found from timeseries GDP data and finally a t-test was performed to test the hypothesis "University town house prices are less affected by a recession"






























*Originally the assignments were done with the use of the Anaconda Jupyter notebook and the latest versions of the libraries used. Some of the assignments have been edited to comply with the Coursera online Jupyter Notebook which at the time of submission was out of date.
